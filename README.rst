Swagger Client Code Generator
*******************************

Because Nebula IDL takes advantage of the grpc-gateway project, the proto file generated by the Swagger gRPC generator is mostly Swagger/OpenAPI compliant.  That is, we can run a code generator on top of the OpenAPI spec that's produced.  See the file in ``gen/pb-go/nebulaidl/service/admin.swagger.json``.

However, in generating HTTP clients from the publicly available Docker images, we found two issues. The Dockerfile in the ``swagger-codegen-cli`` directory fixes these and the final image is used in the `nebulaidl generate script <https://github.com/lyft/nebulaidl/blob/master/generate_protos.sh`_.

#. GO constant redefinition (detailed `here <https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/535>`__)
#. Use version 2.4.0 to solve the pointer struct fields.

To create the image ::

    cd swagger-codegen-cli
    make docker_build

The ``Dockerfile`` will

* Re-build ``swagger-codegen-cli.jar`` with the `fixed go template <https://github.com/grokify/openapi-generator/blob/5a6d4fc1f844181fa113c18c3cf8d2b720f811e8/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/go/model.mustache#L26>`__ using Maven ``mvn clean package``.

* Follows the pattern in the original `CLI <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/modules/swagger-codegen-cli/Dockerfile>`_ to create one with our changes.

Currently, the default host is ``localhost`` for both the clients and the version is ``1.0.0``.
